In this phase, we apply **StandardScaler** from `scikit-learn` to normalize features.  
Standardization is the process of transforming features to have zero mean and unit variance, ensuring that all variables contribute equally to the model.

# ML Standardiation
This project demonstrates the third step in building a Machine Learning pipeline: applying **feature standardization** using `scikit-learn`.  
Standardization is the process of transforming features to have zero mean and unit variance, ensuring that all variables contribute equally to the model.
